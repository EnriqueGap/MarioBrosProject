LWJGL
Lightweight Java Game Library
Is wrapper around many graphics libraries and C-stuff that we can use in Java.
OpenGL
Open Graphics Library: Graphics Library Framework
Is a open source graphics library for window handle and graphics.

We'll learn about rendering
We can't simply just draw a square, we need to create a mesh, sent it to the gpu and use a shader to describe how to draw this mesh
Finally batching sped up our rendering. Instead of draw every single square we can draw them all in a one big batch.

Animation System
Finite State Automata
We use to create animation systems, animation states and animation transitions.

Physics
Static objects and Dynamic Physics
Collision detection and resolution.

User Interface.
Window management

Packaging and distribution
Packaging a Java Game and distribute our game :)
